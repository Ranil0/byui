    <p>Hello everyone! I am from Philippines and so excited to know each one of you and hoping that all of you are doing great. My hobbies are playing table tennis, billiards, and photography sometimes during weekends. I enrolled this course because I wanted to become a Software Developer someday as I have more interest on making codes that would transform into something amazing work of art, like stunning website and apps that we encounter everyday in our lives. Have a wonderful day! </p>
