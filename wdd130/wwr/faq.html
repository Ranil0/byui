          Why whitewater rafting?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Whitewater rafting is a popular outdoor recreational activity that involves navigating a river
			or other bodies of water on an inflatable raft. There are several reasons why people enjoy water rafting 
			because...

Rafting often involves navigating through turbulent and fast-flowing water, 
including rapids. This provides an adrenaline rush and a sense of excitement, making it a thrilling adventure for participants.

 through the rapids. This fosters a sense of camaraderie and teamwork among participants.

Many rafting locations are set in picturesque natural environments. Rafting allows participants 
to experience the beauty of rivers, canyons, and landscapes that may not be accessible by other means.

Most of the time requires participants to use paddling techniques, 
communication skills, and quick decision-making to navigate the river successfully. 
Overcoming the challenges of navigating rapids can be personally rewarding and can contribute to skill development.

Paddling through the water provides a good upper-body workout, as well as engaging the core muscles,
 offering exercise in an enjoyable and dynamic setting.

the stresses of daily life.

        <button class="accordion">
          Is whitewater rafting good for beginners like me?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Yes,it is accessible to a wide range of people, including beginners. Many rafting trips are designed 
with different difficulty levels, allowing both novices and experienced rafters to enjoy the activity.
If you have specific concerns about your ability to participate in a rafting trip, it's a good idea to discuss them 
with the outfitter beforehand. They can provide more information about the specific trip, 
answer any questions you may have, and address any concerns related to non-swimmers participating in the activity.

        <button class="accordion">Does your company provide trained lifeguards on duty?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Our company typically provide trained and certified guides who serve as a form 
			of on-water supervision and assistance, rather than traditional lifeguards. These guides are knowledgeable
			about the specific river they are navigating, trained in water safety, and equipped to handle various
			situations that may arise during the rafting trip. Their primary responsibility is to ensure the safety 
			of participants and navigate the raft through the water, including handling emergencies such as capsizes
			or participants falling into the water.

While the guides are not termed "lifeguards" in the traditional sense, they fulfill a similar role by being
 well-versed in water rescue techniques and first aid. They are trained to respond quickly and effectively 
 to any potential issues, helping to create a safe environment for participants.

It's important to note that participants are usually required to wear personal flotation devices (PFDs)
 or life jackets during the entire rafting trip. These devices provide buoyancy and are a crucial safety measure,
 especially for individuals who may not be strong swimmers.

Before embarking on a whitewater rafting trip, participants typically receive a safety briefing from the guides,
 which includes information on how to respond in case of an emergency, how to wear and use safety equipment, 
 and what to do if someone falls into the water. Following the guides' instructions and being aware of safety 
 protocols is essential to ensuring a safe and enjoyable whitewater rafting experience.
